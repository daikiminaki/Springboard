    "### Notebook Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook I will be using the topic groupings selected in the \"Model and Topic Selection\" Notebook to tag AirBnb Reviews.  There were two models that seemed to have fairly good groupings which were the \"Full Review\" model and the \"Non-Name Entities Plus Adjectvies\" model.  The \"Full Review\" topics seemed to have a broader variety of topics with less groupings per topic while the \"Non-Name Entities Plus Adjectives\" groupings were more in-depth on fewer topics.  To select the best model I hope to try sampling reviews and seeing which topics seem to correspond best with actual reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Outline\n",
    "<strong>Step 1:</strong> Tag all reviews with ALL groupings (Topic Groups) made by each model.<br>\n",
    "<strong>Step 2:</strong> Group the Tags selected in the previous notebook to get Topics for each Review.<br>\n",
    "<strong>Step 3:</strong> Sample a few reviews with the topic categorizations to compare the models.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Results\n",
    "\n",
    "After Taggings, Grouping, and Sampling the topic categorizations for the Airbnb Reviews, I found that the \"Full Review\" model had the categorizations with the best results and seemed to represent the reviews fairly well.  In the next notebook I will use the topic categorizations to conduct analysis on Airbnb reviews hopefully finding some interesting insights on how guests review different listings."

Having a full kitchen, a lovely walkout garden, and TV + DVD + FM stereo were added bonuses. Holly and David were most gracious and met our every request. Being within walking distance of both the Haight Street and Castro Street scenes was great. The only negative for us was the difficulty in finding on-street parking, due to both the density of the neighborhood and the construction work going on. A few evenings we had to park about 4 blocks away. For people who need to use private vehicles, this problem does restrict their plans somewhat. For people who can use public transportation and/or walk, this is no problem.\n",

      "Our experience was, without a doubt, a five star experience. Holly and her husband, David, were the consummate hosts; friendly and accomodating while still honoring our privacy. The apartment was a charming layout with a full view and access to the home's garden The location is perfect for full engagement with the city; close to mass transit with walking proximity to the Haight, the Mission, the Castro and Golden Gate Park. I can't wait for our next visit.\r",

You do not need a car to enjoy the City as everything is within walking distance - great restaurants, bars and local stores. With such amenable hosts and a place to stay that enhances one's holiday, we will be returning again and again.\n",

      "We were very pleased with the accommodations and the friendly neighborhood. Being able to make a second bed out of the futon couch was particularly helpful. Having a full kitchen, a lovely walkout garden, and TV + DVD + FM stereo were added bonuses. Holly and David were most gracious and met our every request. Being within walking distance of both the Haight Street and Castro Street scenes was great. The only negative for us was the difficulty in finding on-street parking, due to both the density of the neighborhood and the construction work going on. A few evenings we had to park about 4 blocks away. For people who need to use private vehicles, this problem does restrict their plans somewhat. For people who can use public transportation and/or walk, this is no problem.\n",

      "We highly recommend this accomodation and agree with the previous postings: Holly and David were extremely helpful and friendly (but not at all instrusive), the unit itself is just superb and in a wondeful location. Unlike some other Airbnb accomodation optins, this is a dedicated rental unit, furnished with consumables (dishwashing liquid etc) and you don't have to contend with someone else's belongings or mess. A perfect and very relaxing end to our holiday, would love to stay there again one day.\n",
